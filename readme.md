This is a small Java program that given the: 
- Interest Rate
- Loan Term
- Loan Amount
- Extra Payment Amount
Will output:
- Monthly Payment
- Original Interest

- New total interest
- Interest saved compared to original total interest
- Total months needed to pay off the loan

If there is an extra payment of $1000 for every month the output will be the:
- New total interest
- Interest saved compared to original total interest
